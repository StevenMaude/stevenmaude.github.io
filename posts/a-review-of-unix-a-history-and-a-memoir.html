                <p>"UNIX: A History and a Memoir" is from the perspective of Brian
Kernighan, who was around at the inception of UNIX, and is well-known in
computing himself as one of the three authors of the AWK language and
the author of a number of other influential books (e.g. "The C
Programming Language" by Kernighan and Ritchie). The title covers most
of what the book deals with: the formative years of UNIX, with
explanation of the key software that was developed as part of it.</p>
<p>It explains where, and from who, UNIX was developed. Initially, UNIX was
one of Ken Thompson's side projects, quickly capturing wider interest
and sparking collaboration within Bell Labs. This was all amid a milieu
of Bell Labs having considerable operating system development experience
as a collective, yet having no operating system to work on. (Bell Labs
had been working on the Multics project, but eventually withdrew its
support.) Eventually, management managed to gather funding for UNIX,
initially with a view to improving how patent applications within Bell
Labs were prepared.</p>
<p>From there, UNIX developed sufficiently that it found wider use within
Bell Labs, within AT&amp;T — Bell Labs' then parent company — and within
many universities. Eventually UNIX was sold commercially. Later, while
various commercial UNIX vendors expended much efforts in commercial
wrangling of various parties, the appearance of the free Linux kernel in
the early 1990s paved the way for Linux distributions to render the
commercial squabbles largely obsolete.</p>
<p>Kernighan's rundown of the features that made UNIX distinct from many of
the competitors at the time explains why UNIX was a key development that
transformed computing at the time, offering:</p>
<ul>
<li>a hierarchical file system;</li>
<li>accessible system calls;</li>
<li>abstraction of other concepts, such as hardware devices, that they
  could be worked with much as regular files;</li>
<li>a command-line shell that could be used composably, along with a suite
  of programs as useful tools, pipes and scripting to connect those
  programs together to effectively create new commands or programs.</li>
</ul>
<p>Half a century on and these features are still evident in Linux and
other descendants that are still being developed today.</p>
<p>Kernighan closes the book by describing factors that made Bell Labs such
a successful research institution. That in itself is an interesting
story that entwines with the development of UNIX. My distillation is
that Bell Labs had an extended period where the organisation:</p>
<ul>
<li>had interesting and challenging problems to solve;</li>
<li>hired very talented staff to solve those problems;</li>
<li>had sufficient resources that the staff weren't worrying about
  funding, while management could take a longer view on projects without
  demanding immediate results;</li>
<li>had a technically competent management;</li>
<li>offered a collaborative and fun environment for this research.</li>
</ul>
<p>All easier written than done, of course. If it were so simple, that
research model would be simply replicated everywhere given the
resources. Nonetheless, this goes some way to summarise why Bell Labs
were so extraordinarily influential and tremendously prolific in 20th
century technology developments.</p>
<p>Finally, the book also puts the development of UNIX into context in
modern-day computing. Many computing devices today run operating systems
that have some connection back to UNIX. Even Microsoft has adopted
several of the ideas made popular by UNIX, and has, at times, veered
closer to UNIX and its descendants, offering Windows Services for UNIX
in the past, Windows Subsystem for Linux in the present and, long ago,
even distributing XENIX, Microsoft's very own UNIX distribution! While
UNIX is over 50 years old, it continues to influence today's computing:
this well-written book certainly helps to understand why that is so.</p>
